This is a practice block. There will be a total of 5 trials, and you must respond with hich accuracy in every trial in order to advance.

On each trial, you will first be presented with an image in the center of the screen. This image will be replaced by a second image, and that's the image you should report afterwards. Your task is to match the second image with an identical image on the color wheel.

Remember that the first image should be ignored, and you should only remember the second image. Also, the second image may be presented very briefly, so pay a lot of attention!

Make a response by first clicking anywhere on the wheel to make the center visible. Then, move your mouse around the wheel until you have found a match. Finally, click again to record your choice. Remember- every place on the wheel will produce a different image, not just the 8 samples around the wheel. You will be given a limited amount of time to make your choice, so try to answer accurately but without taking too long.
