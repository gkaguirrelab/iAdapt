This test of visual perception has 34 sections. Each section takes about 2 minutes, so you should expect the whole experiment to take approximately 60 minutes. Yes, it is long. But it's also fun!

Your payment will depend on how well you perform the tasks. We will calculate your accuracy on each trial, and at the end of each section we will calculate your average accuracy for the section. Your balance will increase depending on how well you did in the task. The higher the accuracy, the more money you make!

If you perform poorly in any of the sections, your experiment will be terminated and you will get paid for the amount you accumulated up to that point. If you keep up with good performance consistently, you will be able to finish the entire experiment. If you complete the entire experiment, you will DOUBLE YOUR EARNINGS! You can make up to $6.60 for the entire experiment.

Once you leave the experiment, enter your completion code on Mechanical Turk and we will pay you a bonus corresponding to your balance. 

You will opportunities to take breaks between sections. During the break period, please keep this window open. If you close the window you may lose all of your progress!
 	
We will give you instructions before the first section. After the instructions, you may be asked a few questions to confirm your understanding. You will need to answer all the instruction questions correctly to continue, but you will have as many tries as you need.
