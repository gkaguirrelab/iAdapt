There will be a total of 12 trials, which should take you a total of 2-3 minutes to complete.

A reminder on the directions:
At the start of each trial, you will be shown a single face in the center of the screen. After a brief pause the face will change to a different "target" face. A fuzzy image will be presented briefly before the face selection wheel appears.

Your task is to match the target (the second face that appeared) with an identical face on the face wheel. The first face and the fuzzy image should be ignored.

Make a response by first clicking anywhere on the wheel to make the center visible. Then, move your mouse around the wheel until you have found a match. Finally, click again to record your choice. Remember- every space on the wheel will produce a different face, not just the 8 images around the wheel. You will be given a limited amount of time to make your choice, so try to answer as quickly as possible.
