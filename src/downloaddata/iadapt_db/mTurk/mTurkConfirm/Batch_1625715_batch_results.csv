I quit long after it stopped being even mildly entertaining, when I felt I was being abused.","The most difficult part was maintaining my motivation to continue, which was totally shot by the time I had enough to buy a fast food hamburger.","If it is not the aim of this experiment to determine how long subjects will persist through mind-numblingly boring, then please take steps to make the experiment more interesting. Even if you were going to throw sections of data in the garbage can, you should mix things up in some way to dull the repetition. I was also quickly able to see what a pathetically marginal difference my performance made in the amount I was paid. The monetary motivation was in no way sufficient to stop me from getting lazy as I went through the successive tests. If you're interested in increasing the volume of data by having a small number of subjects go through endless bullshit with almost zero variation, you need to make it more fun or offer a more interesting reward. As it is, I would feel that anyone who completes the entire set to double their reward probably has some sort of mental quirk or medical condition which you would be exploiting. I only persisted so long because I was hoping for some sort of surprise, or interest. If someone came up with this reward framework and honestly expected it to motivate or stimulate, then it's badly done indeed. Play some videogames! Even a blatant attempt to copy a super-simple blatantly copied reward scheme with zero creativity or nuance would be infinitely better than what you've come up with here. Maybe look into something like a ""score multiplier."" Call the extremely difficult sections where the second image is shown for only a fraction of a second a ""bonus level"" and offer double the pay rate if someone actually performs skillfully. Pretend that you actually care if they're good at it! Offer a consolation prize to losers! Don't be so goddamn stingy!  Actually ff someone is reading this and you know the person who came up with this, please flip them off for me. Alright, one last thing, it should be more obvious that the accuracy percentage only relates to the previous click. You should probably display total accuracy alongside it for an easy fix."
