This next section is very similar to the last, except now faces are now used instead of colors. There will be 120 trials, which should take you about 20 minutes to complete.

A reminder on the directions:
At the start of each trial, you will be shown a single, "target" face in the center of the screen. The target face will be quickly replaced by a fuzzy image, and then the face selection wheel.

Your task is to match the target (first face that appeared) with an identical face on the face wheel. The fuzzy image should be ignored and is not an issue with your computer. 

Make a response by first clicking anywhere on the wheel to make the center visible. Then, move your mouse around the wheel until you have found a match. Finally, click again to record your choice. Remember- every space on the wheel will produce a different face, not just the 8 images around the wheel. You will be given a limited amount of time to make your choice, so try to answer as quickly as possible.
