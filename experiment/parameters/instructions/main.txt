This test of visual perception has 4 sections. Each section takes approximately 20 minutes.

You will have several opportunities to take breaks. During the break period, please keep this window open. If you close the window you will lose all of your progress!

Your accuracy in each section will be calculated. We will give you your total score when you have completed each section.
 	
We will give you instructions before the first section. After the instructions, you'll be asked a few questions to confirm your understanding. You will need to answer all the instruction questions correctly to continue, but you will have as many tries as you need.
