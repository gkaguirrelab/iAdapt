This next practice section is similar to the last, except now faces are used instead of colors. There will be 120 trials, which should take about 20 minutes to complete.

Just in case you don't remember the directions:
On each trial, you will be shown a face selection wheel, as well as a face on the left and right side of the screen. Your task is to match the face on the left and right side of the screen (they will both be the same face) with an identical face on the face wheel.

Make a response by first clicking on the wheel to make the center visible. Then move your mouse around the wheel until you have found a match, and click again to make your choice. Remember- every space on the wheel will produce a different face, not just the 8 images around the wheel. You will be given a limited amount of time to make your choice, so try to answer as quickly as possible.
