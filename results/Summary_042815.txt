SUMMARY OF RESULTS
- there is some correlation across subject in face and color bias. We therefore focus upon one of these (color)
	Face Bias - Color Bias
		DATASET 1: The correlation between Color bias and Face bias is r=0.24 (p=0.0148)
		DATASET 2: The correlation between Color bias and Face bias is r=0.19 (p=0.0557)

- There is across subject variability in color bias that is greater than the within subject variability (this is the technically correct statement of the "individual differences" claim). The same is true of precision (right?). We therefore will examine the relationship between bias and precision both within and between subjects.

		DATASET COLORS ONLY: The mean correlation between Color precision and Color bias within subject is r=-0.09, t(98)=-2.00 (p=0.0482)

- if we modify the experiment to decrease precision, bias further increases

- across colors, there is some consistent pattern to response bias (different from adapt bias)

FUTURE ANALYSES
- Analyze the data across color bins from the working memory experiment to see if there are biases in reporting particular colors from memory (i.e., people tend to mis-remember an aqua as green). I don't recall how finely we randomize the points on the color wheel, but one could imagine describing the data with two color wheels. The inner color wheel would be the veridical color presented, and the outer color wheel would be, for each corresponding angle, the mean color that observers tend to report.

- Vary the angle of the adapter relative to the target. Burges: A smaller angle might produce a larger bias effect. Stocker: Making the measurement across a set of angles may be used to better understand the relationship between precision and bias

- Within subject, examine the slope of the relationship between precision and bias across blocks. Aggregate these slopes across subjects, and see if the set of slopes differ from zero.
