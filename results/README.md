This folder should contain all of the exploratory analyses performed on data, organized into subfolders named after the date when the analyses were initiated

Guidelines:
- Keep subfolders in chronological order
- No data whatsoever should be here
- Each script should read in raw data and produce results (e.g. figures, statistics, tables, etc.)
- Always use relative filenames
- Each result (e.g. figures, statistics, tables, etc.) should be uniquely associated with one script; therefore, only one analysis per folder
- Each analysis should contain:
	- Description of what it does
	- Code (heavily commented)
	- Results + Images
	- Interpretation of the results
- Whenever the analysis file calls a function from ../Code, the specific function that was executed should be saved (either explicitly, saving the whole code, or the git version of it)
- Suggested tool for exploratory analyses: IPython notebooks
